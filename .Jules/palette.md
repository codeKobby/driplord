## 2024-07-25 - GestureDetector is an Anti-Pattern for Buttons
**Learning:** Using `GestureDetector` for interactive elements that should be buttons is an accessibility anti-pattern in Flutter. It does not provide the necessary semantic information for screen readers, nor does it give the expected visual feedback (like a ripple effect) that users associate with buttons.
**Action:** When creating custom interactive elements, always prefer `InkWell` wrapped in a `Semantics` widget. The `Semantics` widget should have `button: true` and a descriptive `label`. The `InkWell`'s child should be wrapped in `ExcludeSemantics` to avoid double announcements by screen readers. For decorated containers, wrap the `InkWell` in an `Ink` widget to ensure the ripple effect is displayed correctly.
